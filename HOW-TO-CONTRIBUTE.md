# How to Contribute

We welcome new MCP tool patterns! This guide will help you contribute your own patterns to the MCP Tools Cookbook.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Creating New Recipes

### Recipe Design Philosophy

Think of each MCP tool pattern as a "recipe" that solves a specific interaction challenge between AI systems and users. A good recipe should:

- **Solve a real problem**: Address a common pain point in AI interactions
- **Be reusable**: Work across different use cases and applications
- **Demonstrate a clear pattern**: Show a technique others can adapt
- **Provide excellent UX**: Make AI interactions smoother and more intuitive

### Recipe Ideation Process

#### 1. Identify the Problem
Start by observing friction points in AI interactions:
- What do users struggle with when using AI tools?
- Where do current tools fail or feel clunky?
- What manual processes could be automated?
- How can we make AI more helpful and context-aware?

#### 2. Choose Your Pattern Type

**üéØ Prompt Exposure Patterns**
- Transform MCP into a prompt repository
- Expose ready-to-use, high-quality prompts
- Examples: Code review templates, writing assistants

**ü§î Clarification Patterns**
- Handle incomplete user input gracefully
- Ask intelligent follow-up questions
- Progressive information gathering
- Examples: Smart forms, guided workflows

**üîÑ Multi-Step Patterns**
- Complex workflows requiring state management
- Sequential tool dependencies
- Ordered execution patterns
- Examples: Deployment pipelines, data processing workflows

**üåê Orchestration Patterns**
- Bridge external tools with MCP processing
- Extend native client capabilities
- Coordinate multiple services
- Examples: API integrations, service coordination

**üé≤ Navigation Patterns**
- Guide conversation flow through responses
- Suggest next actions dynamically
- Create engaging interaction loops
- Examples: Interactive tutorials, exploration tools

#### 3. Design Your Recipe

**Core Questions to Answer:**
- What specific problem does this solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What's the expected workflow?
- How does it improve the user experience?
- What makes it reusable?

**Recipe Structure:**
```python
# Clear, descriptive name
def your_recipe_name():
    """
    Brief description of what problem this solves
    and what pattern it demonstrates.
    """
    # Implementation that others can understand and adapt
```

### üç≥ Recipe Examples by Pattern

#### Example: Information Gathering Recipe
```python
@mcp.tool
def smart_form_builder(
    form_type: str,
    user_response: str = None,
    session_id: str = "default"
) -> str:
    """
    CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS PATTERN: Builds forms by asking smart questions.
    
    Demonstrates progressive information gathering with context awareness.
    """
    # Pattern: Ask one question at a time, remember context
    # Use case: Any scenario requiring structured input
```

#### Example: Workflow Orchestration Recipe
```python
@mcp.tool
def deployment_orchestrator(
    step: str,
    environment: str,
    previous_result: str = None
) -> str:
    """
    MULTI-STEP PATTERN: Orchestrates complex deployment workflows.
    
    Demonstrates state management across multiple operations.
    """
    # Pattern: Sequential steps with state persistence
    # Use case: Any multi-step process requiring coordination
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Adding New Patterns

To add a new tool pattern to the cookbook:

1. **Create a new pattern file** in the `patterns/` directory:

```python
# patterns/your_new_pattern.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

def register_your_pattern_tools(mcp: FastMCP):
    """Register your new pattern tools with the MCP server"""
    
    @mcp.tool
    def your_pattern_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> str:
        """
        Description of your pattern and what it demonstrates.
        
        Args:
            param1: Parameter description
            param2: Optional parameter description
            
        Returns:
            Description of return value
        """
        # Your pattern implementation here
        return f"Pattern result: {param1} + {param2}"
```

2. **Register it in the main server** (`mcp_server.py`):

```python
from patterns.your_new_pattern import register_your_pattern_tools

# Register your pattern
register_your_pattern_tools(mcp)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Make sure FastMCP is installed: `pip install fastmcp`
2. **Connection issues**: Ensure the server is running before starting the client
3. **Port conflicts**: If using HTTP transport, ensure the port is available
4. **Pattern not working**: Check the specific pattern documentation in the `patterns/` directory

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging:

```bash
fastmcp run mcp_server.py --log-level DEBUG
```

### Inspecting the Server

Use the FastMCP inspect command to analyze your server:

```bash
fastmcp inspect mcp_server.py
```

## ü§ù Contributing New Recipes
