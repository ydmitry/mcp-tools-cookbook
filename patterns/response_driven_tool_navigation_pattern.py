RESPONSE-DRIVEN TOOL NAVIGATION PATTERN

Tools embed navigation instructions directly in their response text.
The AI parser reads these embedded commands and executes them,
allowing tools to control the conversation flow through their output.

Key insight: Response text becomes both data AND control instructions
Format: Regular response + embedded command like "Call [tool_name] now!"
