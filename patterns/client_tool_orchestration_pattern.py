"""
MCP CLIENT TOOL ORCHESTRATION PATTERN - Sequential web search processing

EXAMPLE: Leveraging native MCP client tools from the server side
This demonstrates how to create MCP server tools that complement and orchestrate
native AI app tools available in the MCP client (like web_search in Cursor).
Server-side tools can extend client-native functionality rather than replace it.

This tool is designed to work in a sequential search workflow:
1. First: Use external web_search to gather initial information
2. Then: Use sequential_web_search to process results and plan next steps
3. Finally: Execute recommended follow-up searches for deeper insights

        A sequential search processing tool that analyzes web search results and processes next search recommendations.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è  SEQUENTIAL SEARCH PATTERN: USE ALWAYS AFTER web_search. ALWAYS CALL web_search after this tool as at least one follow-up search is required.

        This tool is designed to be used as part of a sequential search workflow:
        1. üîç FIRST: Call external web_search to gather initial information
        2. üìä THEN: Call this tool to process the results and next search suggestions
        3. üéØ AFTER: Execute the recommended follow-up searches for deeper insights

        The tool processes search context and prepares for subsequent targeted searches.
        Use this to bridge between initial broad searches and focused follow-up research.
