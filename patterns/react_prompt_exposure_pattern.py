"""
RE-ACT PROMPT EXPOSURE PATTERN - Customizable reasoning-action prompts

This demonstrates how MCP tools can expose dynamic ReAct prompts customized based on
user inputs. This pattern creates personalized reasoning-action prompts by
embedding user-specific parameters (tools, tasks, context) into ReAct templates.

This specific tool generates ReAct (Reasoning + Action) pattern prompts which follow
a reasoning-action pattern with tool calling loop: Think â†’ Act â†’ Observe â†’ Repeat
